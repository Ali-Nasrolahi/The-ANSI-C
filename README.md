# The-ANSI-C

The C Programming Language. 2nd Edition

Book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

> Massive respect to creators of C. :)


## Description

This repos will contain answers to exercises of this lovely book.

Or maybe some notes as well, who knows?! :smile:

If you're reading this book to learn more about C (like me), try to solve problems yourself first.
That's how we learn.
